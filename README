gear-inches: calculate the gear inches available for a given set of chainring
and cogs.


Implemented as two programs:


gi:

    Usage: gi wheel-diameter tire-size chainrings cogs

    (chainrings are a comma-separated list of chainrings, ie: 48,28)
    (cogs are a comma-separated list of cogs, ie: 12,14,16,19,21,26)


    If called as 'webgi', if generates the output as a html table,
    otherwise it's an ascii table.


gcalc:

    Usage http://..../gcalc.cgi

    On the first call, it spits out a html form so you can fill in the
    wheel size, etc;  submitting that form calls it again, and it gives
    you that html form (populated) + a chart of gear inches.
